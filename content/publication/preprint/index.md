abstract: In this paper,we study parameter estimation for Matérn covariance models for stochastic processes indexed by vertices of graphs. To the best of our knowledge, asymptotic properties of the maximum likelihood estimators for this model or related models on graphs have not been established in the literature yet. First, we establish finite-sample lower bounds on the estimation error valid for all estimators. This leads to minimax-type lower bounds on the rate of any parameter estimator. Specifically, the lower bound on the rate is explicitly expressed in terms of the rate of growth of the eigenvalues of the Graph Laplacian. Next, we provide mild regularity conditions under which the maximum likelihood estimators of the parameter vector are consistent. Finally, we prove central limit theorems for the maximum likelihood estimators.
